# Codex Room Participation

## Status

Approved by the project maintainer in the Codex working session on 2026-10-05,
including this milestone-one specification and the coordinated implementation
plan. Accepted contribution: [issue 1](https://github.com/thoughtkhoral/thought-khoral-workspace-ui/issues/1).
Implementation follows the [plan](https://github.com/thoughtkhoral/thought-khoral/blob/main/.ai/specs/how/codex-room-conversations-implementation-plan.md) and its dependency gates.
Release/tag publication, provider use and service activation require their
separate later authorization. No completed runtime or live verification is claimed.

## Governing sources

- [Root Codex room requirements](https://github.com/thoughtkhoral/thought-khoral/blob/main/.ai/specs/what/codex-chat-agent.md)
- [Root Decision 009](https://github.com/thoughtkhoral/thought-khoral/blob/main/.ai/specs/decisions/009-codex-chat-agent.md)
- [Contracts profile](https://github.com/thoughtkhoral/thought-khoral-contracts/blob/thought-khoral-agent-conversation-v1.0.0/.ai/specs/how/agent-conversation-profile.md)

## Responsibility

Expose an admitted Codex room participant with explicit direct addressing,
shared-session start/continue/new controls, supported model/effort selectors,
confirmed settings, context telemetry/unavailable state, and safe errors. Humans
can continue each other's authorized room thread. Public replies appear once in
the normal room transcript. Do not trigger inference from aliases or agent messages.

## Acceptance criteria

- Explicit human addressing produces exactly one authorized task and public reply;
  ordinary messages, aliases, quoted mentions, and agent replies do not invoke it.
- Full authorized room-wide baseline and later ordered deltas preserve discussion
  across multiple humans, worker restart, hidden sequence gaps, and browser reload.
- Targeted content, another room, wrong generation/base/digest, stale authority,
  unknown admission, and late/duplicate conflicting terminal results are rejected.
- Fresh native threads receive authorized room history again; reset cannot run
  while busy and never silently restores the previous thread after failure.
- Supported controls and unavailable capabilities follow the exact profile;
  model denial never silently substitutes a model and usage is last-request based.
- Retained room fixtures and deterministic Reference Agent regression gates pass.
- Repository-specific deliverables/tests in the [implementation plan](https://github.com/thoughtkhoral/thought-khoral/blob/main/.ai/specs/how/codex-room-conversations-implementation-plan.md)
  pass before its milestone is accepted; live coverage is identified separately.

## Exclusions

Directory guidance/curated-memory bundles are milestone two. Autonomous turns,
private/shared-audience exceptions, host repository editing, production admission,
and arbitrary external agents remain outside milestone one.
